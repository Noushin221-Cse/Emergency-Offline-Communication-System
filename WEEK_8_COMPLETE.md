# Week 8: Message Encryption and Data Handling - COMPLETE

## Summary
Week 8 implementation focuses on adding encryption for transmitted messages and implementing proper message queueing with delivery confirmation.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Message Encryption Service ✓
- **File**: `lib/services/encryption_service.dart`
- **Features**:
  - AES-256 encryption using the `encrypt` package
  - Automatic key generation and storage using SharedPreferences
  - Encryption/decryption methods for message content
  - Singleton pattern for service access
  - Initialization check to ensure service is ready

**Key Methods**:
- `initialize()`: Initializes encryption service and generates/loads keys
- `encrypt(String plainText)`: Encrypts message content
- `decrypt(String encryptedText)`: Decrypts message content
- `isEncrypted(String text)`: Checks if text is encrypted

### 2. Message Model Updates ✓
- **File**: `lib/models/message_model.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `isEncrypted` field to Message class
  - Updated `toJson()`, `fromJson()`, `toMap()`, `fromMap()` methods
  - Updated `copyWith()` method to include `isEncrypted` parameter

### 3. Database Schema Updates ✓
- **File**: `lib/database/database_helper.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Database version upgraded from 2 to 3
  - Added `is_encrypted` column to messages table
  - Added migration logic in `_upgradeDB()` method
  - Added column existence check in `_ensureColumnsExist()` method

### 4. Encryption Integration in Mesh Network Service ✓
- **File**: `lib/services/mesh_network_service.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added EncryptionService instance
  - Integrated encryption before sending messages
  - Messages are encrypted automatically (except ACK messages)
  - Encryption happens during:
    - Direct message sending
    - Message forwarding
    - Message broadcasting

**Encryption Logic**:
- Messages are encrypted before transmission
- ACK messages are not encrypted (performance optimization)
- Already encrypted messages are not re-encrypted

### 5. Decryption Integration in Message Provider ✓
- **File**: `lib/providers/message_provider.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added EncryptionService instance
  - Messages are automatically decrypted upon receipt
  - Decrypted messages are stored in database
  - Error handling for decryption failures

**Decryption Logic**:
- Encrypted messages are decrypted before storage
- Decrypted content is stored in database
- ACK messages skip decryption

### 6. Delivery Confirmation with ACK Messages ✓
- **Files**: 
  - `lib/providers/message_provider.dart`
  - `lib/models/message_model.dart` (ACK type already existed)

**Features**:
- Automatic ACK generation for received messages
- ACK messages contain the original message ID
- ACK messages are not encrypted (performance)
- Delivery status updated when ACK is received

**ACK Flow**:
1. Message sent → Encrypted → Transmitted
2. Message received → Decrypted → ACK sent
3. ACK received → Original message marked as delivered

### 7. Enhanced Message Queueing ✓
- **File**: `lib/services/message_queue_service.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Integrated with MeshNetworkService for sending
  - Added pending messages tracking with timestamps
  - Timeout-based retry mechanism (30 seconds)
  - Delivery confirmation integration
  - ACK messages excluded from queue

**Queue Features**:
- Tracks sent messages waiting for ACK
- Retries messages that timeout
- Marks messages as delivered when ACK received
- Cleans up old pending messages

**Queue Methods**:
- `markMessageDelivered(String messageId)`: Called when ACK received
- `getPendingMessagesCount()`: Returns count of pending messages
- `clearPendingMessages()`: Clears pending tracking

### 8. Service Initialization ✓
- **File**: `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added encryption service initialization at app startup
  - Initialization happens during splash screen

## Technical Details

### Encryption Algorithm
- **Type**: AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Mode**: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
- **Key Management**: Stored in SharedPreferences
- **IV (Initialization Vector)**: Generated and stored per device

### Message Flow with Encryption
```
1. User sends message
   ↓
2. Message encrypted (content only)
   ↓
3. Encrypted message transmitted via Bluetooth/WiFi Direct
   ↓
4. Message received and decrypted
   ↓
5. ACK message sent back to sender
   ↓
6. Original message marked as delivered
```

### Security Considerations
- All message content is encrypted in transit
- Encryption keys are device-specific and stored locally
- ACK messages are not encrypted (contain only message IDs)
- Decrypted messages are stored in database for local access

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
1. `lib/services/encryption_service.dart` - Encryption service implementation

### Modified Files:
1. `lib/models/message_model.dart` - Added isEncrypted field
2. `lib/database/database_helper.dart` - Added is_encrypted column
3. `lib/services/mesh_network_service.dart` - Integrated encryption
4. `lib/providers/message_provider.dart` - Integrated decryption and ACK handling
5. `lib/services/message_queue_service.dart` - Enhanced queueing with ACK support
6. `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart` - Added encryption service initialization

## Testing Notes

### To Test Encryption:
1. Send a message between two devices
2. Verify message content is encrypted in transmission
3. Verify message is decrypted and readable on receiver
4. Verify ACK is sent and delivery status updates

### To Test Queueing:
1. Send message when recipient is offline
2. Verify message is queued
3. When recipient comes online, verify message is sent
4. Verify ACK received and message marked as delivered
5. Verify timeout retry for failed messages

## Known Limitations
- Encryption uses shared keys (same key for all devices)
- For production, consider implementing key exchange protocol
- ACK messages don't have delivery confirmation (no ACK for ACK)

## Next Steps (Week 9)
- UI integration and optimization
- Battery usage optimization
- Testing under various network conditions
